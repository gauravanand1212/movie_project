Movie Trailer Website
--------------------------------

This application generates a web page where users can view 
trailers of some of my favorite movies

The zip file contains the following files:
-----------------------------------------
------| entertainment_center.py
------| fresh_tomatoes.py
------| fresh_tomatoes.html
------| media.py
------| README.txt

How to run the application:
------------------------------------------
- You need to have Python 2.7 installed on your machine
- In terminal, navigate to the folder where the unzipped files are stored
- Run the command => Python entertainment_center.py

This will generate fresh_tomatoes.html which will open up in your web browser
with posters of my favorite movies. Click on any movie to watch the trailer
